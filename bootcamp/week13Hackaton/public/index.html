    <h1>Nova Festival</h1>
    <p>The massacre at the Reim music festival took place on October 7, 2023, at the onset of the conflict between Gaza and Israel. During Operation Flood of Al-Aqsa, when Hamas militants penetrated Israel from the Gaza Strip and attacked an outdoor music festival near Reim. ZAKA, Israel's community emergency response team, recovered approximately 364 bodies from the festival grounds, making it the largest attack in the past 50 years. In addition to the dead, there were numerous injuries and a large number of attendees were taken hostage, of whom their whereabouts are still unknown. The festival was being held that year on Shabbat, in the Negev Desert, near the Urim kibbutz, five kilometers from the fence dividing Israel from the Gaza Strip. Survivor testimonies spoke of close-range executions as attendees tried to escape. Several foreign citizens, including Thais, Britons, Mexicans, and Americans, were kidnapped during the attack.</p>
    <p>The attack on the festival, estimated to have between 3000 and 4000 attendees at the time, appeared to be coordinated and premeditated. As the festival progressed, alarms were sounded for missile strikes. Some of the attackers arrived by paragliders, while others arrived armed in vans or motorcycles, bearing Hamas group insignias and bursting in shouting while the music continued to play, and indiscriminately firing at attendees, spreading chaos.</p>
    <h2>Why Did I Make the Game?</h2>
    <p>I decided to create this game as a way to remember and honor the victims of the Nova Festival massacre. While it may seem unconventional to incorporate real-life tragedy into a game, I believe it can serve as a powerful reminder of the human cost of conflict. By encountering representations of the deceased at the electronic music festival in the game, players have the opportunity to reflect on the impact of violence and the importance of peace. The use of real names and ages adds authenticity to the experience, honoring the memory of those who lost their lives.</p>
