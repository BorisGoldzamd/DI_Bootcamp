This project is  aimed at commemorating the victims of the Nova Massacre festival tragedy, providing a platform for remembrance and reflection. 
The initiative showcases an interactive experience through PIXI.js, allowing users to engage with the memorial and pay their respects.

The project comprises various components, including the creation of NPC (non-playable character) animations and the implementation of interactive elements within the scene.
 The use of PIXI.js demonstrates a creative approach to memorialization, offering users an immersive environment to navigate and explore.

One commendable aspect of the project is the incorporation of NPC animations, which bring a sense of life and movement to the memorial.
 These animations contribute to the emotional impact of the experience, allowing users to connect more deeply with the stories being shared.

However, there are areas where the project could be further enhanced. 
For instance, while the NPC animations add visual interest, ensuring that each character's presence contributes meaningfully to the overall narrative could heighten the project's impact.

Additionally, ensuring that the project's codebase is well-organized and documented could facilitate future development and maintenance efforts.
 Clearer commenting and structure within the code would assist both developers and collaborators in understanding and building upon the project.

Unfortunately, Node.js was solely utilized to serve static files in this project.
 The decision not to leverage Node.js for dynamic content delivery or database interaction may limit the project's scalability and potential for interactivity.
 Incorporating server-side functionality could enhance the project's ability to provide personalized experiences for users, fostering deeper engagement with the memorial.

In conclusion, this project represents a heartfelt tribute to the victims of the Nova Massacre festival tragedy.
 Through its innovative use of technology and thoughtful design, it provides a space for remembrance and reflection, fostering a sense of community and solidarity among users.
